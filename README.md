ESC324 Project with Hshmat Sahak and Vince Tran

We explore various approaches to predict the Yelp rating of a restaurant using photos of the food from customer reviews. On a dataset of over 20,000 image-rating pairs, we first train CNNs from scratch and find best benchmark results (MSE = 0.299) using a network with two convolution layers and a fully connected layer. Next, we test three popular pre-trained networks: VGG16, ResNet50 and MobileNetv2, as well as an early-fusion ensemble approach combining the three. The pretrained/ensemble networks fail to improve upon the test-set MSE from before. MobileNetv2 is the best of the pretrained/ensemble networks with MSE = 0.308. Last, we propose a novel architecture VGH-Net. VGH-Net training occurs in two stages. First, using a CNN to predict BERT embeddings of a restaurantâ€™s text reviews from image data. Then, using a feed-forward neural network to predict the review-specific restaurant rating from the review BERT embedding. VGH-Net achieves a MSE = 0.308.
